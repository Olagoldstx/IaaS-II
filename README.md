# IaaS Security Deep Dive: From Theory to Employment

## Project Objective
This repository is a comprehensive 2-day deep dive into IaaS security fundamentals, designed by an aspiring Cloud Security Architect. It translates complex cloud security concepts into actionable knowledge through:
1.  **Deep Analogical Reasoning:** Making abstract concepts tangible.
2.  **Hands-On Multi-Cloud Labs:** Implementing security controls on AWS, Azure, and GCP.
3.  **Architectural Visuals:** Communicating design impact to non-technical management.

The final goal is to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice, creating a portfolio piece that demonstrates the skills required to secure a job in cloud security.
